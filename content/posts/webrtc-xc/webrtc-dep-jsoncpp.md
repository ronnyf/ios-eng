## JSON C++

JsonCpp is a C++ library that allows manipulating JSON values, including serialization and deserialization to and from strings. It can also preserve existing comment in unserialization/serialization steps, making it a convenient format to store user input files.

## Swift Package Manager

A new Swift package was created to build static and dynamic libraries with Xcode / SwiftPM.
