## Abseil - C++

Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ library code designed to augment the C++ standard library. The Abseil library code is collected from Google's own C++ code base, has been extensively tested and used in production, and is the same code we depend on in our daily coding lives.

## Swift Package Manager

A new Swift package was created to build static and dynamic libraries with Xcode / SwiftPM.
