## LibOPUS

Opus is a codec for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet.

Opus can handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including
Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game  chat, and even remote live music
performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high
quality stereo music.

## Swift Package Manager

A new Swift package was created to build static and dynamic libraries with Xcode / SwiftPM.
